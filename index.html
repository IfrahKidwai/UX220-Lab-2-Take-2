                Raised in a religious Muslim household, the most memorable and important thing I've read would be the Quran. It resonates with me due to the fact that it is the book of my beliefs.

            Though I may not understand the Quran right away while I'm reading, being that it is originally written in Arabic, it brings me a lot of peace due to it being the words of God. With that being said, there are english translation which I do also like to read to understand and take in the teachings.
